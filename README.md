# My Data Science Projects

A collection of data science projects I have worked on, both out of interest and for Kaggle entries.

This is mostly maintained as a portfolio for myself, but I hope someone else can find some use for it!

NOTE: contrary to best practice, I won't maintain a develop branch in this repository since there isn't really a meaningful way to test/build the code here

# Repository Structure

## Interest

These are projects I carried out just out of interest, without any particular goal.

## Kaggle

These are the notebooks I have used to work on Kaggle projects, with data included where possible/practical.
